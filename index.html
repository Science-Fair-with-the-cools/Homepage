      <h2 id="subdesc">What is EcoTraQ</h2>
      <p id=projectsubdesc>People live their everyday lives oblivious that every decision they make alters their impact on our
        environment. EcoTraQ is a carbon footprint calculator that helps people understand and reduce their
        environmental impact, it is a tool for tracking personal emissions and website carbon footprints. Users input
        their lifestyle choices or website links to see how much carbon they release. By comparing userâ€™s results with
        the average emissions released per capita, we can better understand how to live a more efficient lifestyle. Our
        project aims to raise awareness for individuals to take action towards a more sustainable future.</p>

    <h2 id="subdesc1">What is SiteTraQ</h2>

    <p id=projectsubdesc1>Every single website on the internet has a carbon footprint. Physical hosting servers use electricity that use non-renewable energy sources to keep our internet alive as we know it. Want to know what a website's annual carbon footprint is?
